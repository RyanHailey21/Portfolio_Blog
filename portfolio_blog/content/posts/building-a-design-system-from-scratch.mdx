## Introduction

Creating a design system from scratch is one of the most rewarding challenges in frontend development. It requires careful planning, thoughtful token architecture, and a deep understanding of how components will be used across an application.

In this post, I'll walk through the process of building a **copper-themed design system** that balances industrial aesthetics with modern web development practices.

## The Foundation: Design Tokens

The first step in any design system is establishing a robust token foundation. We started with a warm, paper-like palette:

- **Background**: `hsl(40 33% 93%)` - A crème canvas that feels tactile
- **Foreground**: `hsl(30 6% 16%)` - Deep charcoal for excellent readability
- **Primary**: `hsl(28 56% 46%)` - Copper accent for brand moments

These tokens cascade through the entire system, ensuring consistency without rigidity.

## Typography Hierarchy

Typography is where personality really shines through. We chose three complementary typefaces:

1. **DM Serif Display** - For headings and titles
2. **Source Sans 3** - For body copy and UI elements
3. **JetBrains Mono** - For labels, tags, and technical data

### Implementation Example

```typescript
const serif = DM_Serif_Display({
  variable: "--font-serif",
  subsets: ["latin"],
  weight: ["400"],
  display: "swap",
});
```

This approach uses CSS variables to make fonts globally accessible while maintaining performance through Next.js font optimization.

## Component Patterns

Every component in the system follows the same principles:

- Subtle borders and shadows
- Copper hover states for interactivity
- Consistent border radius (`0.25rem`)
- Uppercase mono labels for technical precision

### Button Variants

We implemented three core button variants:

1. **Primary** - Copper gradient with shadow
2. **Ghost** - Transparent with copper hover
3. **Outline** - Border-first with copper focus

## Animation Philosophy

Motion should be deliberate and mechanical. We implemented three core animations:

- `spin-slow` (20s) - For decorative gears
- `fade-in-up` (0.8s) - For page entry
- `bounce-soft` (1s) - For scroll indicators

All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility.

## Conclusion

Building a design system is an iterative process. Start with solid foundations, establish clear patterns, and let the system evolve with your product.
