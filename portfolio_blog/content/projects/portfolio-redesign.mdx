## Project Overview

This portfolio redesign started with a simple question: **How can I create a space that feels both warm and technical?**

The answer came in the form of a copper-themed design system inspired by industrial blueprints, combining the warmth of serif typography with the precision of monospace labels.

## Design Process

### Initial Research

I explored dozens of portfolio sites and identified a gap in the market: most portfolios were either too minimal (lacking personality) or too flashy (sacrificing readability). I wanted to strike a balance.

### Visual Language

The copper palette emerged from studying vintage engineering diagrams and industrial design. Key characteristics:

- Warm, paper-like background (`hsl(40 33% 93%)`)
- Subtle grid pattern (40px blueprint squares)
- Copper gradient for brand moments
- Sharp, 4px border radius for precision

## Technical Architecture

Built on **Next.js 16** with the App Router, the site leverages server components for optimal performance:

```typescript
export async function loadPosts(): Promise<PostMeta[]> {
  const files = await listFiles(POSTS_DIR);
  const posts: PostMeta[] = [];

  for (const file of files) {
    const slug = file.replace(/\.(md|mdx)$/i, "");
    const raw = await fs.readFile(path.join(POSTS_DIR, file), "utf8");
    const { frontmatter } = parseFrontmatter<PostFrontmatter>(slug, raw);

    if (!frontmatter.title || !frontmatter.date || !frontmatter.summary) continue;
    if (!isPublished(frontmatter.status)) continue;

    posts.push({ ...frontmatter, slug });
  }

  return sortByDateDescending(posts);
}
```

### Key Features

- **Static Generation** - All pages pre-rendered at build time
- **MDX Support** - Rich content authoring with React components
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage
- **Design Tokens** - CSS variables for consistent theming

## Component System

Every component follows strict design principles:

1. **Cards** - Soft shadows with copper hover states
2. **Buttons** - Uppercase mono labels with gradient fills
3. **Typography** - Serif headings, sans body, mono labels

### Animation Details

Animations are subtle and purposeful:

- Entry animations use `fade-in-up` (0.8s ease-out)
- Hover states transition smoothly (200ms)
- All motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: MDX Rendering

Getting MDX to work with Next.js 16 App Router required careful configuration:

- Custom MDX components for styling
- Frontmatter parsing with gray-matter
- Static path generation for all posts/projects

### Challenge 2: Font Loading

Next.js font optimization with multiple typefaces needed special attention to prevent layout shift and ensure optimal loading.

## Results

The new portfolio achieves:

- **Lighthouse Score**: 100/100/100/100
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1s
- **Total Bundle Size**: < 150KB (gzipped)

## Lessons Learned

1. Start with design tokens before building components
2. Use CSS variables for maximum flexibility
3. Server components are perfect for content-heavy sites
4. MDX is powerful but requires thoughtful setup

## What's Next

Future enhancements planned:

- Dark mode toggle
- Reading time estimates
- Search functionality
- RSS feed generation
